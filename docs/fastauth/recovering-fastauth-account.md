# Recovering FastAuth Account

FastAuth Account Recovery

FastAuth offers a resilient account recovery system, featuring a Single Sign-On (SSO) mechanism tied to the user's registered email address. This recovery process is fortified by a decentralized approach utilizing multi-party computation, adding an additional layer of security. Crucially, this method avoids conferring complete custodial access to any single entity, providing an enhanced level of protection for user data.
