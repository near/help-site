# Changing / Updating Email Address

Can I change the email address associated with my FastAuth account?

### **Question:**

Can I change the email address associated with my FastAuth account?

### **Answer:**

Currently, it is not possible to change the email address associated with your FastAuth account, including wallets and accounts ending in (.near). This limitation is due to the current features and functionalities of the FastAuth system.

### **What You Can Do:**

If you need to use a different email address, you have the following options:

1.  **Create a New Account:** You can create a new FastAuth account using your preferred email address. This will be a completely separate account from your existing one.
    
2.  **Abandon Your Current Account:** If you no longer wish to use your current account with the existing email address, you can simply stop using it and create a new one as mentioned above.
    

### **Future Updates:**

We understand the importance of being able to update your email address and are actively working on this feature. It is currently on our development roadmap. However, we do not have a definitive timeline for when this feature will be available.
