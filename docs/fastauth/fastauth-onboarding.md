# FastAuth Onboarding

Onboarding onto FastAuth

Simplified onboarding and email recovery are at the core of FastAuth, empowering users to effortlessly create a unified account usable across any website or application integrated with the Blockchain Operating System (BOS). This feature is particularly advantageous for developers working on NEAR components.

FastAuth provides a user-friendly Web2-style onboarding experience, allowing users to establish a free account swiftly using biometrics, phone prompts, and an email address. This facilitates quick interaction with apps and seamless re-authentication across various devices.

The conventional use of seed phrases and wallets in Web3 account management has posed a substantial entry barrier for users accustomed to centralized authentication methods like "Sign in with Google." However, by integrating FastAuth with decentralized email recovery, users are relieved from the need to remember seed phrases or install third-party wallet applications. Account recovery employs a "Single Sign-On" (SSO) process using the registered email, and the decentralized approach, utilizing "multi-party computation," ensures secure recovery without granting full access keys to a single custodian.

FastAuth eliminates one of the most challenging aspects of onboarding users to Web3, allowing users to set up a BOS account more swiftly than creating accounts on popular platforms of Web 2.0. For developers, this means delivering Web3 components, apps, and experiences with enhanced seamlessness.
