# Creating a FastAuth Account

Steps to create a new FastAuth account

### **Fast-Auth:**

BOS FastAuth introduces a groundbreaking feature that simplifies the onboarding process for Web3, revolutionizing the way users interact with applications. Traditionally, entering the Web3 space required acquiring cryptocurrency upfront.

FastAuth changes the game by enabling new users to start immediately without the need to purchase or receive crypto as a gift. This is a significant advantage for developers, enterprises, and end-users alike. Leveraging NEAR's Meta Transactions and Zero Balance Accounts, FastAuth allows users to register an account without any associated costs. Developers can utilize Meta Transactions in conjunction with relayers to sponsor initial interactions for new users, eliminating the requirement to buy $NEAR.

### **Account Creation Flow:**

1) Input Email Address + Select Username

2) Passkey Prompt will display in your Browser

3) Email Notification with Login Link will be sent to Email Address
