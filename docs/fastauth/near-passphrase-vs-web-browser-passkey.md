# NEAR Passphrase vs Web Browser Passkey

Differences in Passkeys vs Passphrases

In the world of digital security, it's crucial to understand the difference between a NEAR passphrase and a web browser passkey. This guide aims to clarify the distinction between these two concepts to help users navigate the complexities of online authentication securely.

## NEAR Passphrase:

The passphrase, often referred to as the seed phrase, is a critical element of wallet security across various blockchain networks. When setting up the blockchain wallet, users receive a distinct passphrase comprised of multiple words. This passphrase functions as the primary key to enter and manage the respective wallet and the digital assets stored on the blockchain. Safeguarding this passphrase is paramount, as unauthorized access to it could grant control over the wallet and its contents. It's important to note that if the passphrase is lost or compromised, there is no recourse for recovery, emphasizing the importance of securely storing and protecting this sensitive information.

## Web Browser Passkey:

On the other hand, a web browser passkey typically refers to a feature within web browsers that stores login credentials for websites visited by the user. This passkey allows users to automatically log in to websites without manually entering their usernames and passwords each time. While convenient for streamlining the login process, users should exercise caution when relying on web browser passkeys, as they may pose security risks if the browser is compromised or accessed by unauthorized individuals.

### Key Differences:

1.  **Purpose:** The blockchain passphrase is specifically designed for securing blockchain wallets and controlling digital assets on the NEAR Protocol. In contrast, a web browser passkey is intended to simplify the login process for websites visited using the browser.
    
2.  **Security:** The blockchain passphrase is crucial for protecting wallet assets and must be kept confidential at all times. In contrast, web browser passkeys are stored locally on the user's device and may pose security risks if the device is compromised.
    
3.  **Scope:** The blockchain passphrase is unique to each NEAR wallet and provides access to blockchain-based assets. Web browser passkeys, on the other hand, are associated with specific websites and facilitate login to those sites only.
