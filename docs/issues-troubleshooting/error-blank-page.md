# Error: Blank page

Blank Page interacting with Wallet

You may see the blank page instead of the wallet interface in case your account doesn't have sufficient balance to complete the login process. This normally happens if you receive multiple airdrops or you have fungible tokens connected to your account.


The solution is to add a small number of NEAR tokens (0.25 is normally enough) to unblock the system.
