# Deleting Social Activity on NEAR Social

NEAR Social Social Activity Deletion

Users are encouraged to use the designated buttons on posts, profiles, and widgets for actions like unliking, unfollowing, and unstarring.

On the cleanup page, actions such as hiding a post or profile, unreporting, and deleting widgets are efficiently managed. Users can navigate to the Cleanup Page ([https://near.org/mob.near/widget/Cleanup](https://near.org/mob.near/widget/Cleanup)) for these specific operations.
