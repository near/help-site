# Understanding NEAR Support for Third-Party Apps and Wallets

Support for Third-Party Apps and Wallets

At NEAR Support, we strive to provide comprehensive assistance to our community members navigating the NEAR ecosystem. However, it's essential to clarify our scope of support, especially concerning third-party applications and wallets. While we are here to guide and assist users to the best of our abilities, there are limitations to the assistance we can provide for issues related to external apps and wallets.

-   **Guidance and Navigation:** Our primary role is to help users navigate the NEAR ecosystem and find solutions to their queries. If you encounter challenges while using third-party apps or wallets, we are here to assist you in finding the appropriate support channels. Whether it's directing you to the official support resources or providing guidance on how to reach out to the respective support teams, we aim to ensure that you receive the assistance you need.
    
-   **Scope of Support:** It's important to note that NEAR Support is not directly responsible for the development or maintenance of third-party applications or wallets. Therefore, while we can offer general guidance and troubleshooting tips, we may not have the expertise or access to address specific issues within these platforms. Our support extends to helping users understand how to interact with NEAR-related features or functionalities within these applications.
    
-   **Utilizing Official Channels:** For the most effective support experience, we encourage users to leverage the official support channels provided by third-party app and wallet developers. These channels are equipped with the necessary resources and expertise to address user inquiries promptly and effectively. While we are here to assist you in finding these channels, direct communication with the respective support teams often leads to quicker resolution of issues.
