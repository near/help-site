1. **Check Your Browser:** Transactions tend to work best on Google Chrome or Brave browsers. Ensure you are using one of these browsers, and it's essential to stay within the same browser without clearing your cache while performing transactions. This error can occur due to a mismatch between the locally stored key pair.

2. **Try the Following Steps:**

a. Remove your account from the Wallet: Simply use the red button located under "Account."

b. Clear your browser's cache.

c. Re-import your account: You can find detailed instructions on how to import your account [in our helpful guide](/hc/en-us/articles/1500002248242-Creating-a-NEAR-Wallet-account).
