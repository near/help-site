# Tokens vs Protocol

What's a Token?

In the realm of blockchain and decentralized systems, it's crucial to differentiate between protocols and tokens. While they are often interconnected, they serve distinct purposes and function independently in the ecosystem.

### **Protocol:**

-   A protocol defines the rules and standards for communication and interaction within a network.
    
-   It establishes the framework for how nodes or participants in a network communicate, validate, and reach consensus.
    
-   Protocols govern the technical aspects of decentralized systems, such as data transmission, validation mechanisms, and network governance.
    

### **Tokens:**

Tokens represent digital assets or units of value within a blockchain ecosystem.

-   They can serve various functions, including facilitating transactions, accessing network features, or representing ownership rights.
    
-   Tokens are often built on top of existing protocols, utilizing the underlying infrastructure to enable decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts.
