# What is NEAR?

Welcome to NEAR!

## Welcome to NEAR: The User-Friendly and Sustainable Blockchain

At NEAR, we're proud to introduce you to a blockchain that's designed to be not only high-performing and secure but also user-friendly and environmentally conscious. Let's dive into what NEAR is all about:

### **NEAR in Technical Terms:**

In technical jargon, NEAR is a [layer-one](https://blockchain-comparison.com/blockchain-protocols/) blockchain that employs [sharding](https://near.org/blog/near-launches-nightshade-sharding-paving-the-way-for-mass-adoption) and operates on a [proof-of-stake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake) consensus mechanism. It's engineered with the user experience at its core, ensuring it's accessible and practical for everyone.

### **NEAR in Simple Terms:**

Put simply, NEAR is blockchain made for everyone.

### **Why Choose NEAR?**

Here's why NEAR stands out and why you should consider it for your blockchain needs:

1.  **User-Friendly:**
    - NEAR uses [**human-readable** accounts](https://docs.near.org/concepts/basics/accounts/model#human-readable-accountsaccount-idmd) _(e.g._ `alice.near`) making transactions more intuitive.
    - It offers a web-based wallet, eliminating the need to install software or browser extensions.
    - NEAR features a straightforward yet robust system of Access Keys for managing account permissions.
    
2.  **Fast and Environmentally Friendly:**
    - Transactions on NEAR are lightning-fast, taking only around 1 second to process.
    - Transaction fees are exceptionally low, costing less than 1 cent.
    - NEAR is certified as a [**carbon-neutral network,**](https://near.org/blog/the-near-blockchain-is-climate-neutral/) and its energy consumption is [**a fraction of what Bitcoin consumes**](https://medium.com/nearprotocol/how-near-went-carbon-neutral-e656db96da47#:~:text=The%20firm%20found%20that%20NEAR,PoS%20technology%20instead%20of%20PoW).
    
3.  **Great Developer Experience:**
    - Developers can create smart contracts using familiar languages like JavaScript or Rust.
    - NEAR's comprehensive documentation and numerous examples simplify the onboarding process.
    - NEAR DevRel hosts office hours daily, offering support and guidance.
    - Developers receive 30% of gas fees as rewards.
    
4.  **A Technical Marvel:**
    - NEAR's [sharding](https://near.org/blog/near-launches-nightshade-sharding-paving-the-way-for-mass-adoption) technology allows it to scale infinitely and withstand usage spikes.
    - It's interoperable with Ethereum through the trustless [Rainbow Bridge](https://rainbowbridge.app/transfer).
    - NEAR is Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible, offering easy deployment of Solidity contracts through [Project Aurora](http://www.aurora.dev/).
