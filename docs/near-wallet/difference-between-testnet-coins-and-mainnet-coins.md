# Difference Between Testnet Coins and Mainnet Coins in NEAR Protocol

Understanding the Difference Between Testnet Coins and Mainnet Coins in NEAR Protocol

### What Are Testnet Coins?

Testnet coins are virtual tokens used in the NEAR Protocol's Testnet environment. The Testnet is a parallel blockchain designed specifically for testing and development purposes. It allows developers to experiment with new features, deploy smart contracts, and test applications without risking real assets.

**Key Characteristics of Testnet Coins:**

-   **No Real Value:** Testnet coins are not real and have no monetary value. They are purely for testing and simulation.
    
-   **Abundant Supply:** Testnet coins can be obtained easily and in large quantities, often through a faucet provided by the Testnet environment.
    
-   **Testing Purpose:** These coins are used to test transactions, smart contracts, and other functionalities within the Testnet without any financial risk.
    

### What Are Mainnet Coins?

Mainnet coins are the actual tokens used on the NEAR Protocol's Mainnet, which is the live blockchain network where real transactions occur. These coins hold real value and are used for all operations on the Mainnet, including transactions, staking, and paying for transaction fees.

**Key Characteristics of Mainnet Coins:**

-   **Real Value:** Mainnet coins represent real assets with monetary value and can be bought, sold, and traded on cryptocurrency exchanges.
    
-   **Limited Supply:** The supply of Mainnet coins is regulated by the network’s protocol, and they cannot be obtained freely like Testnet coins.
    
-   **Operational Use:** These coins are used for executing real transactions, participating in network governance, staking to earn rewards, and paying for transaction fees on the NEAR Mainnet.
    

### Key Differences

1.  **Value:**
    
    -   **Testnet Coins:** No real value, purely for testing.
        
    -   **Mainnet Coins:** Hold real monetary value.
        
2.  **Purpose:**
    
    -   **Testnet Coins:** Used for testing and development.
        
    -   **Mainnet Coins:** Used for real transactions and operations on the Mainnet.
        
3.  **Availability:**
    
    -   **Testnet Coins:** Freely available from Testnet faucets.
        
    -   **Mainnet Coins:** Must be bought or earned.
        
4.  **Transferability:**
    
    -   **Testnet Coins:** Cannot be transferred to Mainnet or converted to Mainnet coins.
        
    -   **Mainnet Coins:** Can be traded and transferred within the Mainnet.
        

### Can You Convert Testnet Coins to Mainnet Coins?

No, it is not possible to convert Testnet coins to Mainnet coins. They exist in separate environments and serve different purposes. Testnet coins are intended for testing without financial risk, while Mainnet coins are the actual cryptocurrency used in the NEAR Protocol’s live environment.
