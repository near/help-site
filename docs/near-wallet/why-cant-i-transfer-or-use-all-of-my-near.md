# Why can't I transfer or use all of my NEAR?

Transfer or use all your NEAR balance

### Managing Your Minimum NEAR Balance

Your NEAR account is subject to a minimum balance requirement, which is determined by the storage you are utilizing on the NEAR network. Here are the minimum balance scenarios:

1. **2FA Enabled:**If you have enabled Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for your account, the minimum balance required will be approximately 3.5 NEAR.

2. **Lockup Account:** If you have a lockup account, the minimum balance for that account will be 3.7 NEAR.

3. **2FA Enabled with Lockup:** If you have both 2FA enabled and a lockup account, the combined minimum balance will be around 7.2 NEAR.

You have the option to reclaim this minimum NEAR balance by taking the following actions:

1. **Disable 2FA:** If you wish to lower your minimum NEAR balance, you can disable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for your account. This will reduce the minimum balance requirement.

2. **Transfer NEAR from Lockup:** If you have a lockup account, you can lower the minimum NEAR balance by transferring all of your NEAR tokens out of your lockup account. Please note that this should be done after your lockup period has ended.

By following these steps, you can adjust your minimum NEAR balance to meet your specific needs on the NEAR network.
